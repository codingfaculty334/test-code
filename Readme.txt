I can make it more flexible and convenient using laravel default classes. I mostly work on query optimization with refactoring
and clean coding. I add some more helping classes so that our application become more secure. I add different layers
each layer has its own working purposes i.e i add a service layer with contract in this code so our whole business logics
will be written in this layer.
